## BrickMMO Stacks

The BrickMMO Smart City was initially designed to provide developers with a sandbox to practice their coding skills. The BrickMMO Smarty City consists of over 30 online assets, from [BrickMMO Branding Guidelines](https://branding.brickmmo.com/), to the project management application [Flow](https://flow.brickmmo.com/), to the official [BrickMMO Website](https://brickmmo.com/). 

To provide some consistency, all BrickMMO assets use one of four stacks for the frontend, and one of three stacks for the backend. These stack range in complexity to allow any developer with any level of experience to contribute.

### Frontend Templates

All BrickMMO assets use one of the following frontend stacks:

#### 1. Markdown

Skill Level Required: **Low**  
Language: **Markdown and HTML**

These assets are written primarily in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) (or vanilla HTML when required). Markdown must follow [_readme](https://readme.codeadam.ca/) guidelines. Assets are hosted using GitHub Pages and uses GitHub's Markdown processor called [jekyll-commonmark](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/github-pages/).

#### 2. W3.CSS

Languages: **HTML, JavaScript, and W3.CSS**

These assets are written using the [W3.CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/) CSS framework. This is a super lightweight framework that provides developers a great introduction to CSS frameworks. These assets must be coded using **only** W3.CSS classes; no custom CSS may be added (other than default fonts and colours that have been set in the W3.CSS BrickMMO template).
