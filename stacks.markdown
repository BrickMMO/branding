## BrickMMO Stacks

The BrickMMO Smart City was initially designed to provide developers with a sandbox to practice their coding skills. The BrickMMO Smarty City consists of over 30 online assets, from [BrickMMO Branding Guidelines](https://branding.brickmmo.com/), to the project management application [Flow](https://flow.brickmmo.com/), to the official [BrickMMO Website](https://brickmmo.com/). 

To provide some consistency, all BrickMMO assets use one of four stacks for the frontend, and one of two stacks for the backend. 

These stack range in complexity to allow any developer with any level of experience to contribute.

### Frontend Templates
